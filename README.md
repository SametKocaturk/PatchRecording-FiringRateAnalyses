PatchRecording-FiringRateAnalyses

This project is designed for firing rate analyses of MATLAB exports of “Signal” software (CED Inc.) patch recording. “main.m” searches for data named with format of “yymmddData*” in the current directory and guides the user through spike detection. After that, you can visualize the raster plot by “rasterPlot.m” or you can visualize and analyze the peristimulus time histogram by “periHistKW”.
